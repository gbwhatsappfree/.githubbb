## Key Features of GB WhatsApp Pro v18.30

The latest update, **GB WhatsApp Pro v18.30**, brings several exciting new features and bug fixes. Some of the standout features of this version include:

### 1. **Login Issue Fixed**
   One of the key improvements in GB WhatsApp Pro v18.30 is the fix for login issues. In earlier versions, some users reported problems with logging into the app after installation. With this update, the login functionality has been optimized, and the process has become smoother and more reliable, eliminating the frustration many users had previously faced.

### 2. **Custom Themes and User Interface**
   GB WhatsApp Pro gives users the ability to fully customize the look and feel of the app. Users can apply various themes, change the font style, and adjust the color scheme to match their preferences. You can even import themes from other users, giving you a vast selection of designs to choose from.

### 3. **Enhanced Privacy Features**
   GB WhatsApp Pro includes several advanced privacy features not found in the official WhatsApp app. These include:
   - **Hide Online Status**: Users can hide their online status so others won't know when they're active on the app.
   - **Hide Blue Tick**: The blue tick that appears when a message is read can be hidden.
   - **Hide Second Tick**: Similarly, the second tick that appears when a message is delivered can also be concealed.
   - **Anti-Delete Messages**: You can read messages even if the sender deletes them.
   - **Anti-Delete Status**: Similar to the anti-delete messages feature, you can view status updates even after the sender deletes them.

### 4. **Multiple Accounts on One Device**
   GB WhatsApp Pro allows you to use two WhatsApp accounts simultaneously on the same device. This feature is particularly useful for people who want to separate personal and professional contacts without using multiple devices or apps.

### 5. **Increased Media Sharing Limits**
   The original WhatsApp imposes limits on the size of media files that can be sent. For instance, video files are limited to 16 MB, and images can only be sent at a lower resolution. However, with GB WhatsApp Pro, users can send larger video files (up to 50 MB), high-quality images, and even APK files without encountering restrictions.

### 6. **Enhanced Group Features**
   GB WhatsApp Pro adds additional functionality to WhatsApp groups. For example, you can send a broadcast message to a larger group of people than allowed in the official version, and you can manage group settings with greater flexibility. Additionally, admins have more control over group features, such as managing participant permissions and customizing group settings.

### 7. **Customization of Notification Sounds**
   GB WhatsApp Pro lets you set custom notification sounds for different chats or groups. You can assign different notification tones to individual contacts, which helps in distinguishing between personal, work, and group conversations without needing to check the screen.

### 8. **DND (Do Not Disturb) Mode**
   With the Do Not Disturb mode in GB WhatsApp Pro, you can temporarily disable all incoming messages and calls while using other apps. This is particularly useful when you're trying to focus on something important and don't want to be distracted by notifications.

### 9. **Extended Emoji Options**
   GB WhatsApp Pro offers a wide variety of emoji options, allowing users to customize the style of emojis. You can select between different emoji sets, such as iOS, Google, or Facebook emojis, giving your messages a fresh and personalized touch.

### 10. **Improved File Sharing**
   GB WhatsApp Pro allows you to share a variety of file types, including APKs, large videos, and other media, with minimal restrictions. The app supports sending files up to 100 MB in size, significantly higher than the official appâ€™s limits.
